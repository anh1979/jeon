/**
 * Each homeserver publishes its public keys under /_matrix/key/v2/server/. Homeservers query for keys by either
 * getting /_matrix/key/v2/server/ directly or by querying an intermediate notary server using a /_matrix/key/v2/query API.
 * Intermediate notary servers query the /_matrix/key/v2/server/ API on behalf of another server and sign the response with their own key.
 * A server may query multiple notary servers to ensure that they all report the same public keys.
 * <br>
 * This approach is borrowed from the Perspectives Project, but modified to include the NACL keys and to use JSON instead of XML.
 * It has the advantage of avoiding a single trust-root since each server is free to pick which notary servers they trust and can
 * corroborate the keys returned by a given notary server by querying other servers.
