/**
 * Application services may declare which protocols they support via their registration configuration for the homeserver.
 * These networks are generally for third party services such as IRC that the application service is managing.
 * Application services may populate a Matrix room directory for their registered protocols, as defined in the Client-Server API Extensions.
 * <br>
 * Each protocol may have several "locations" (also known as "third party locations" or "3PLs"). A location within a protocol is a place
 * in the third party network, such as an IRC channel. Users of the third party network may also be represented by the application service.
 * <br>
 * Locations and users can be searched by fields defined by the application service, such as by display name or other attribute.
 * When clients request the homeserver to search in a particular "network" (protocol), the search fields will be passed along
 * to the application service for filtering.
