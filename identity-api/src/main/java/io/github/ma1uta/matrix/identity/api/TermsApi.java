/**
 * Identity Servers are encouraged to have terms of service (or similar policies) to ensure that users have agreed to their
 * data being processed by the server. To facilitate this, an identity server can respond to almost any authenticated API
 * endpoint with a HTTP 403 and the error code M_TERMS_NOT_SIGNED. The error code is used to indicate that the user must
 * accept new terms of service before being able to continue.
 * <br>
 * All endpoints which support authentication can return the M_TERMS_NOT_SIGNED error. When clients receive the error,
 * they are expected to make a call to GET /terms to find out what terms the server offers.
 * The client compares this to the m.accepted_terms account data for the user (described later) and presents the user with option
 * to accept the still-missing terms of service. After the user has made their selection, if applicable,
 * the client sends a request to POST /terms to indicate the user's acceptance.
 * The server cannot expect that the client will send acceptance for all pending terms, and the client should not expect that
 * the server will not respond with another M_TERMS_NOT_SIGNED on their next request.
 * The terms the user has just accepted are appended to m.accepted_terms.
